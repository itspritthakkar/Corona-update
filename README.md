## About Corona update

Corona update as the name suggests fetches the latest updates of Covid-19 cases of a specific country. It is written in Laravel, a PHP framework and Twilio api is used as a backend. 

The user endpoint of this api is a phone number on which the user is required to send the name of country for which he/she is interested to know Covid-19 updates about. And in return the api fetches the summary of the Covid cases in that country with the timestamp on which it was last updated.
